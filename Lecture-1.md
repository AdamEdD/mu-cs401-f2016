## Machine Learning and Neural Networks - cs401 - Barak Pearlmutter

### Lecture 1

_Language of choice for this course is Python_

In 1959, Arthur Samuel defined [**machine learning**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) as a _"Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed"_

Computers are a hassle to program -> Automatic Programming = Machine Learning

#### Areas concerned with Machine Learning include:

- [Computer Vision](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-relation-between-machine-learning-image-processing-and-computer-vision)
- [Natural Language Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing)
    - machine translation
- [Statistics](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/07/difference-machine-learning-statistical-modeling/)
    - [Mike Jordan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_I._Jordan)
- [Neuroscience](https://www.quora.com/Where-are-the-interesting-topics-which-intersect-Neuroscience-and-Machine-Learning) - [Psychology](https://www.quora.com/How-can-Machine-Learning-be-applied-in-Psychology-and-Cognitive-Science)
    - _"General Purpose learning mechanisms deployed for specific puropses"_
    - [Santiago Ramón y Cajal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_Ramón_y_Cajal) discovered neurons 
- Physics; Certain Physics math is similar to machine learning math such as:
    - reducing error systems = reducing energy systems
    - stochastic systems = thermo dynamics
- [Information theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory): [Claude Shannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon) 
    - information = entropy
- [Control Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory) [(Hamilton Institute)](http://www.hamilton.ie/publications/diego_thesis.pdf)
    - Engineering discipline of controlling a device
    - [Adaptive Control Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_control)
    - [Differential games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_game)
    
    
#### Crude taxonomy

[**Supervised Learning:**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning) Labelled data
- input x<sup>i</sup> -> y<sup>i</sup> output
- Input and some targeted output i.e predicting house prices

[**Unsupervised Learning:**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning) Unlabelled data
 - Learn structure
 - Take a bunch of unlabelled data and discern some structure from the data. i.e [clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) , [Tesco](http://www.computing.co.uk/ctg/feature/2455426/how-do-you-like-them-apples-the-data-analytics-powerhouse-behind-tesco-groceries)
